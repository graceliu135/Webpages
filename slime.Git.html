    <h1>How to Make Slime!</h1>
    Are you wondering how to make slime?<br>
    Whether you want to make slime since your friends are playing with it to simple curiosity, this how to is just for you!<br>
    <h2>Activator</h2>
    Now, I will tell you about actavator, the things that turns glue, into slime! <br>
    I will teach you how to make borax actavator, although you may have heard your friends talking about using tide of contact solution.You can learn how to make it online or somewhere else. But here we will be using borax activator.<br>
    To make it, you have to have borax, and water. You take a cup and pour some water in. Add some borax and then mix until it looks like water again.
    If the activator is too strong, the slime will become a rock. If the activator is to weak, the slime will become watery.<br>
    If you want your slime to last, you should always put it in  airtight container. If the slime smells off or is discolored, please throw it out. If the slime is liquidy put it in the fridge for 30 minutes. If that doesn’t work, add a little bit of activator so it becomes the right texture. <br>
    If the slime is too hard, add in some lotion if the slime is opaque, and if the slime is clear, soak it in a little bit of water in an airtight container overnight.<br>

Tip:If you want to add color to your slime, you should use food coloring or paint. <br>
If you are using food coloring and using 1 bottle of glue (small size), then one or two drops should be fine.<br> 
If you are using less amount of glue, then 1 drops or less will be enough. <br>
